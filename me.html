                        I care about chasing democratization for the underrepresented alongside mission-driven companies that lead with empathy and an aggressive urgency that collectively excites internal employees and external users alike. I'm most comfortable leading a team, but can't deny my rockstar contributions with whereever I'm pointed.

                        When I'm not thinking about my career, you can find me running long-distance, trying to keep my spunky Golden Retriever out of whatever body of water he sees, watching cult classics, shooting film on my old Contax T2, thrifting in Brooklyn, or playing around with ChatGPT and Midjourney.
